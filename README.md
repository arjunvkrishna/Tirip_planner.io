Because apparently, basic math and Google Maps are too hard.

So, You're Planning a Trip?
Wow, how ambitious. You're actually leaving your house. Congratulations.

You probably thought it would be easy. Just pick a place and go, right? Then you remembered you have to pay for things. Like petrol. And food. And that questionable hotel your friend recommended. Suddenly, your spontaneous road trip involves spreadsheets, frantic Googling, and a mild sense of dread.

Fear not, you magnificent, disorganized creature. I have built the solution you didn't even know you needed, because I, too, am a master of procrastination and poor planning.

"Features" You'll Wonder How You Lived Without
üìç Origin & Destination Input: Groundbreaking, I know. You type where you start and where you want to go. Don't worry, I'll wait.

üìç Live Location Button: For those moments when you forget where you are. Just click the button and let the internet spy on you for your own convenience. It shows your district, not your exact house, so your secrets are safe. Probably.

‚õΩ Fuel Cost Calculation: Finally, a way to know exactly how much of your soul you'll have to sell to afford the petrol for this trip. It even fetches live fuel prices, because I'm just that extra.

‚òÄÔ∏è Weather Forecasts: Will you need a jacket or will you melt into a puddle of regret? Now you'll know. You're welcome.

‚ûï Add Stops: Because who doesn't love a detour? Add as many stops as you want. Go on, make that 4-hour drive a 12-hour epic. Live your truth.

üí∏ Expense Tracking: Input your hotel, food, and "miscellaneous" costs (we all know what that means). See the grand total and have a small panic attack in the comfort of your own home.

‚úåÔ∏è Dual Vehicle Support: Planning a trip with a friend who has a "more efficient" car? Now you can calculate costs for two vehicles and argue about who should drive.

üìÑ PDF Export: Get a fancy, official-looking document of your trip plan. Perfect for convincing your friends, family, or yourself that you actually have your life together.

How This Marvel of Engineering Works
Enter Your Locations: Try to spell them correctly. The app isn't a mind reader.

Add Your Vehicle's Pathetic Mileage: Be honest. No one's judging your 10 km/L.

Toss in Your Other Expenses: Don't forget the budget for overpriced snacks.

Click "Calculate Trip": Brace yourself.

Stare at the Results: Absorb the data. See the route on the map. Question your life choices.

It's basically rocket science, but for road trips.

Why Did I Build This?
Because my last road trip was planned on the back of a napkin, cost me twice what I expected, and I ended up in the wrong city. This is not a tool born from passion; it's a monument to my own failure. A digital scar.

Now, you get to benefit from my trauma. Enjoy.

The "Tech Stack" (aka, stuff I glued together)
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: The holy trinity of "I have an idea for a website."

Leaflet.js: For the pretty map that shows you how lost you're about to get.

Gemini API: The all-knowing oracle that tells me fuel prices and travel times. Yes, I'm using AI. I'm modern.

Nominatim API: For turning your creepy GPS coordinates into a place name.

Go Ahead, Use It
Seriously, what are you waiting for?
